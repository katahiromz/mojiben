Some characters represent sounds and others represent meanings.
Hiragana and katakana represent sounds. Kanji can have more than one sound and meaning.
Furthermore, when multiple kanji are combined, they form a kanji idiom, which can have different meanings.
You can say you have mastered a character only once you can read, write, pronounce, and understand it.

Correct stroke order trains you to write neatly and get things done efficiently.
Stroke order is also used as a sanity check in job hunting. Don't underestimate stroke order.

Kanji can be read in two ways: on-yomi and kun-yomi.
Onyomi is a reading style introduced from ancient China. Kunyomi is a reading style unique to Japan.

It's a good idea to start by studying hiragana and katakana.
